# Overview

**libcharsets** is a small static library written in C23 in order to handle multiple character sets such as **ascii**, **utf-8** and **utf-16**.

This library does not claim to be faster/more efficient than any other library or than the standard (I didn't run any benchmark anyway), it is mainly a learning experience consisting of reinventing the wheel (again).

## Documentation

None at the moment. The library is still under development and the API is far from being stable. However, I plan to use it in my other personal projects, so it **might** become stable at some point (unlike too many of my private repositories).

## Download & Build instructions

Please don't. Use a correct library instead.  
Don't make your code unsafe on purpose.
